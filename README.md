## About Weather Widget

I use Vanilla Javascript for this project, is fast & easy, by using https://darksky.net api to pull all the necessary weather information we need, is free '1000 api calls'.
For icons i use [Skycons](https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons) is Opensource you can get here in github.
